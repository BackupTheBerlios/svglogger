			The trace viewer combined with the trace server, part of the openccm module, represents  a
			web enabled test environment that can be used to visualize execution traces between CORBA objects
			within a CCM context. The application is designed as part of the
			<a href="http://coach.objectweb.org/">COACH IST project</a>. The next figure shows a simplified schematic of
			the architecture:
		</p>

 		</p>
 		<p>More information about the test environment can be found in COACH deliverable D2.7
 		<a href=http://coach.objectweb.org/results/COACH-D2.7.zip>Specification of the component test environment</a>
		<p>The trace viewer is designed and tested on the following platform:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows 2000 machine, service pack 4</li>
			<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6.0</li>
			<li>Apache Web Server version 2.0.44 extended with FastCGI module version 2.4.0</li>
		</ul>
		<h2><a name='installation'></a> Installation </h2>
		<p>
		There are two configuration files that need to be modified in order for the trace viewer to work. The first one is
		the fcgi.conf file that can be found in the trace viewer /conf subdirectory. The second one is the
		httpd.conf file which is part of the Apache installation. The latter can be found in the Apache /conf subdirectory.
		</p>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li><p><b>fcgi.conf file - </b> The trace viewer will be part of a web server and communicates
				   with the trace server using FCGI (persistent version of CGI). The fcgi.conf file is needed for the
				   web server to load the FCGI module, to be able to connect to the trace server, and to find
				   the trace viewer web files. The file <b>must</b> be modified to point to the location where the trace viewer
				   files are installed. It also specifies where the trace server is running (hostname and port).</p>
			       <p>Note: The fcgi module library can be found in the trace viewer /lib subdirectory. It is
			       a pre-build version for Apache running on a WIN32 machine. If you want to run the Apache server
			       on a machine with a different operating system then you need to build the library yourself. The source
			       code and documentation can be found on the <a href="http://fastcgi.com">fcgi home page</a>.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>httpd.conf file - </b> The Apache web server must load the fcgi.conf file so it needs to be included
				   at the end of the httpd.conf file which can be found in the Apache /conf subdirectory. This is how the
				   include should look like:</p>
				   <p><b>Include "&ltabsolute trace viewer path&gt/conf/fcgi.conf"</b></p></li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
		To test the trace viewer you need to build and install the OpenCCM environment including the COACH test
		applications (trace server/service). There is a separate target <b>build coach</b> that will build the
		OpenCCM code and the COACH software.</p></li>
		</p>
		<h2><a name='running'></a> Running the Applications </h2>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li><p><b>Apache - </b>After the configuration files are correctly modified you should be able to (re)start
			the web server. </p></li>
			<li><p><b>Browser - </b>The next step is to start the web browser (IExplorer 5.5+) and type in the URL
			pointing to the trace viewer <pre>http://&lthostname&gt[:port]/coach/tracing</pre> In case your machine does not
			have an installed Adobe SVG ActiveX control (version 3.0), you will be redirected to the Adobe SVG install
			page. Now you should install the SVG plugin on your machine. After the plugin is installed you will see the
			trace viewer HTML page which has 5 page control buttons and two sliders on the left side. When you see these,
			you know the viewer is loaded correctly. You also get an alert message that the viewer can not find the
			trace server. This is ok since the server is not started yet.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>OpenCCM - </b> After you have build and installed the OpenCCM platform you should be able to start
			the trace server using the command 'coach_tracing_start'. The server is now ready to collect operation events. To
			test the trace server together with the trace viewer you could run the test program 'coach_tracing_test'. This
			program simulates a number of operation between CORBA components that can be monitored by the trace viewer.
			The result should look like follows:</p>

		<h2><a name='guide'></a> Viewer Users Guide </h2>
		<p>
			The next figure shows a real life example that will be used to explain the trace viewer features. It shows the
			execution traces of a simple client/server application. The client sends request to the server from
			two different threads. This is the reason why the operation lines can cross each other,
			there is no causual relationship between the operations originating the two different threads. This complicates
			the interpretation of the results. Later on we will see how to change the graphical presentation to
			identify the two different threads, of which the operations both represent a sequence of causally related events
			(trail), more easily.

 			<ol>
 				<li>
 				<h3><a name='pc'></a> Page Control </h3>
 				<p>
 					The page control panel allows the user to change the view in the horizontal as well as the vertical
 					direction. In the vertical direction this means that the viewer will send a request to the trace
 					server to retrieve a different portion of the operation events stored within the server database. The
 					vertical step size, applicable to the North/South buttons, can be modified.
 					It is defined as a percentage of the maximum number of (vertical direction) events that fit within
 					the visible region of the view panel window.
 				</p></li>
 				<li>
 				<h3><a name='ec'></a> Entity Control </h3>
 				<p>
 					The entity control panel shows the relationship between the entities by means of a tree view and allows the
 					user to manage the graphical representation of those entities. Within the CCM environment this relationship
 					is as follows:
 					<ol>
 						<p>
 							<b>node::process::container::component::object</b>
 						</p>
 					</ol>
					The user can choose which level in the hierarchy will be visible by collapsing or expanding tree nodes.
					The next figure shows an example where the tree is collapsed to show the client/server invocations
					at the container level.
					<p>
						<img src='fig4.jpg'>
 					</p>
 					It is also possible to control the visibility of the entities by clicking with the mouse on the text of a tree
 					node. Hidden nodes show up in red. The next figure shows an example where the 'StructHandler' component of the
 					client is hidden. As you can see this will also hide the corresponding invocations.
 					<p>
						<img src='fig5.jpg'>
 					</p>
 				</p></li>
 				<li>
 				<h3><a name='oc'></a> Operation Control </h3>
 				<p>
 					The operation control panel is opened by clicking with the left mouse button on the name of an operation. The
 					panel functionality is threefold. It allows the user to filter out operation types, filter out
 					operation to self, and filter out unmatched events. Operations to self are operations that have there start
 					and endpoint positioned on the same time line. Unmatched events are events that have no peer event. Normally
 					every operation has a start and endpoint represented by two related events. The next two figures show an
 					example how to hide all the 'get_struct' operations
  					<p>
						<img src='fig6.jpg'>
 					</p>
 					<p>
						<img src='fig7.jpg'>
 					</p>
 					The return to the Entity Control panel you should position the mouse on one of the timelines and click the left
 					mouse button.
 				<p></li>
 				<li>
 				<h3><a name='ep'></a> Event Parameter Panel </h3>
 				<p>
 					By positioning the mouse over an event and clicking the left mouse button you can activate the event
 					panel showing the operation parameters for that specific event. The next figure shows an example of
 					the 'get_struct' operation reply parameters. Note that this feature only works for C++ applications.
 					The Portable Interceptor concept for Java does not support the retrieval of parameter values. <b>For
 					Java applications the parameter tree will be empty.</b>
  					<p>

 					</p>
 				</p></li>
  				<li>
 				<h3><a name='cm'></a> Context Menus </h3>
 				<p>
	 				By moving the mouse over a certain area of the view panel window and clicking the right mouse button you will
	 				activate one of the following three context menus.
	 				<p><ol>
	 					<li><p>
		 					<h4><a name='dcm'></a>Default Context Menu</h4>
		 					<p>
		 						The default context menu is the Adobe plugin menu that gives you for example the
		 						possibility to Zoom In or to Zoom Out. The next two figures show you what happens after
		 						a Zoom Out action. Note that the size of the tooltip panel remains unchanged so that
		 						you can still identify certain event or entity properties.
		 					</p>
		 					<p>
								<img src='fig9.jpg'>
 							</p>
		  					<p>
								<img src='fig10.jpg'>
		 					</p>
		 				</p></li>
		 				<li><p>
		 					<h4><a name='ecm'></a>Event Context Menu</h4>
		 					<p>
		 						When you position the mouse over an event and click the right mouse button you can popup
		 						the Event Context Menu. This menu is used to filter out all events from the top down to
		 						the place where you activated the menu.
		 						This is very useful when the server database contains numerous (e.g. 20000) events
		 						and you no longer are interested in showing all events prior to the event on which you
		 						activated the context menu. The next two figures show what happens when you hide previous
		 						events. Note that the behavior is as if the events are thrown away at the server side.
		 						This is not the case, you can always retrieve them as you can see by looking at the
		 						second context menu item.
		 					</p>
		 					<p>
								<img src='fig11.jpg'>
		 					</p>
		 					<p>
								<img src='fig12.jpg'>
		 					</p>
		 				</p></li>
		 				<li><p>
		 					<h4><a name='ocm'></a>Operation Context Menu</h4>
		 					<p>
		 						As already mentioned within the <a href='#guide'>Viewer Users Guide</a> introduction, the
		 						operation lines can cross each other when they are not causally related.
		 						This means they also have a different trail id (sequence of causally related events).
		 						We can use this trail id feature to give every trail a different color which simplifies
		 						the interpretation of the results. The next two figures show how to color a trail. The
		 						context menu is activated when moving the mouse over an operation line and clicking the
		 						right mouse button.
